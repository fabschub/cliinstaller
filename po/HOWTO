Here is a short explanation how to create translations for installer-cli.

***WORK IN PROGRESS***


The File installer-cli.pot holds all the information for use with gettext. If there are changes in installer-cli script the file needs to be recreated (normaly not necessary for translators):

  xgettext -L SHELL /path/to/installer-cli -o /path/to/po/installer-cli.pot


If you want to create a new translation file for your language you have to do (example for german = de):

  msginit --locale=de --input=/path/to/po/installer-cli.pot -o /path/to/po/installer-cli.de.po

Edit this file and add your translation.


After you have finished your translation you can create a binary for your language with:

  msgfmt -o /path/to/locale/de/LC_MESSAGES/installer-cli.mo /path/po/installer-cli.de.po

Note: You have to create the dirs in local first! Maybe you need to change TEXTDOMAINDIR in installer-cli to test your changes.


If there are changes in installer-cli.pot you can update your po file with (example for german = de):

  msgmerge -U -v /path/to/po/installer-cli.de.po /path/to/po/installer-cli.pot

Note: -v means verbose and gives a better output. After that edit your po file and maybe follow creating a binary for your language.
